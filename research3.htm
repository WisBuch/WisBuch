        <h4>  ABSTRACT </h4>
        <p> <br><center><b><i>Electronic books are quickly becoming more prominent in the field of education because of their
            advantages over traditional printed textbooks. As more electronic textbooks are being produced and
            utilized in classrooms, we must investigate just how useful and effective they are in teaching young
            children the important skills they need for higher learning. This paper reviews some of the current
            views on the topic for teaching and learning and discusses how electronic books can be integrated into
            the classroom learning environment. Research has shown that when used as a teaching supplement,
            electronic books have a positive impact on learning. They can be valuable in helping children with their
            early literacy development, reading comprehension, and language development.</p> <br>

            <h3> I. Introduction </h3>
            <p> <br>Electronic 
                books (or e-books) can be defined
                as any group of text in a digital format that
                is to be read and displayed on a computer
                screen. They can be accessed in a myriad of
                different ways including through the internet, on a
                CD-ROM or by many of the portable e-book
                readers available on the market. Many types of
                content are also available for free download or
                purchase including popular fiction, non-fiction, as
                well as educational titles (Maynard, 2005, p. 103).
                This emerging technology has opened the
                possibility for a large range of new learning
                experiences for students because of its advantages
                over traditional printed textbooks. Electronic
                books often contain rich multimedia features that
                cannot be found in textbooks. These frequently
                include recordings of the text read-aloud, lively
                animations, music, video and various sound
                effects. Young children are found to especially
                respond well to these enhanced features (Korat,
                2008, p.111). Many companies are now producing
                more electronic textbooks for use in classrooms as
                researchers believe that they can prove to be
                excellent supplementary material for teachers, as
                well as being quite effective in early literacy
                development, reading comprehension and language 
                development for young children (De
                Jong, 2004; Grant, 2004; Grimshaw, 2007;
                Higgins, 1999; Korat, 2008; Lewin, 2000;
                Maynard, 2005). This paper highlights the
                successes of children’s interactions with electronic
                books in their learning environments. </p> <br>

            <h3>Studies on Children’s Interactions with E-books:</h3> 
            <p><br>Grimshaw (2007) believes that rich multimedia
                features such as audio narration, sound effects and
                animations embedded into electronic books can
                very much help children improve their reading
                comprehension skills. The reasoning is that these
                features support the text, help the child "decode"
                new words and children actually improve on their
                understanding of the text (p.584). If a book has
                audio narration and also highlights the text as it
                goes along, the child is able to follow along much
                easier. Sound and 3-D animation in the electronic
                text can help illustrate meaning to young children
                and can provide better examples in comparison to
                a traditional 2-dimensional book. Voice narration
                also aids children in pronunciation of particular
                words and helps with understanding of syntax.
                Children also respond well to these features
                because if they need help defining or pronouncing
                the words, they can instantly access help for themselves within the electronic book. There is the
                added advantage of a degree of privacy as many
                children are shy and reluctant to ask a teacher for
                help in a classroom setting. Some children are
                impatient, choosing to ignore the fact that they do
                not understand the text, and will just keep on
                reading anyway (p.585). When children are
                motivated to read and to do so without fear of
                failure, they also tend to excel in reading at or
                above their grade level (p.586). Electronic texts
                can provide this kind of support to them because it
                actively engages their minds.
             </p> <br> 
            <p> Many researchers acknowledge the
                difficulty in measuring comprehension of text
                (Grimshaw, 2007; Grant, 2004; Higgins, 1999). It
                can be very complicated simply because of many
                of the other complex variables involved, one of
                which is memory. Children can often forget parts
                of the narrative when a person asks them to re-tell
                the story or answer questions based on their
                reading of a text for purposes of testing. Just
                because they may forget some of the events of the
                reading, it does not necessarily mean they failed to
                grasp the concepts of the story. Grimshaw’s 2007
                study on children’s reading and comprehension
                skills based on print versus electronic text attempts
                to resolve this issue by allowing children to have
                access to the text as they are being tested. They
                also challenge the children in their study to make
                inferences to test their deeper understanding of the
                story. They did not want to have the children
                simply practice information retrieval (p. 586).
                They tested children under several different
                conditions including having them read the
                electronic text of the storybook with and without
                narration, animations and sound effects. Although
                the results showed that children took longer
                reading from a computer screen when compared to
                a printed book, the children who read from the
                book took longer to answer the comprehension
                test. The children who had been placed in the test
                group that had access to a CD-ROM version of the
                story with narration turned on generally did the
                best on the comprehension test. However, no other
                significant results could be seen amongst the other
                groups. Some useful and pertinent observations from the test included that the children made very
                good use of the electronic dictionary that was
                easily accessible within the CD-ROM version of
                the text (p. 595). This far exceeded any use that
                came from the paper version of the dictionary.
                Children also generally like following the text of a
                traditional printed book with their finger. They
                were unable to do so with the electronic text that
                was displayed to them on the computer, and this
                must have factored into the slower reading time as
                well (p. 596). Additional students also mentioned
                that narration in the electronic version helped them
                when they did not know the pronunciations of
                certain words (p. 597).</p> <br> 
           <p>  Maynard (2005) also conducted a study
                comparing how much children learn from
                electronic text in comparison to printed text. This
                test differentiates itself from other tests in the fact
                that children were tested both on an individual
                basis as well as learning in groups. Half the
                children used a printed book to answer questions
                and the other half used an electronic CD-ROM,
                which was filled with animations, sound effects,
                music and video. The results showed that those
                who used the electronic textbook did better on the
                comprehension tests than those who used the
                printed textbook even though they did take longer
                to find the relevant answers to the questions they
                were asked. The researcher observed that the
                children who were working with the CD-ROM
                version of the text seemed to be more productive
                and were quieter using the text in groups. They all
                took turns rotating around the computer to ensure
                everyone had a turn accessing the text. It was a
                very different scenario compared to the students
                using the printed textbook. These children seemed
                bored and uninterested easily. The researcher did
                concede that there might have just been a “novelty
                effect” (p. 110) with the students using the CD-
                ROM version of the textbook. Another point to
                note is that the children who were using the CD-
                ROM version had to ask several times for help
                including questions on how to navigate back to the
                different sections that they needed as there are no
                simple search ability. The children using the
                textbook needed no help using it, as children are generally familiar and competent in learning to use
                the contents and index pages of a book. This is a
                clear advantage that this medium has over
                electronic text (p. 111).</p> <br>
                <p>De Jong’s study on children’s
                    understanding of stories presented to them
                    electronically posits that additional features such
                    as sound effects and animations actually can
                    interfere with children’s comprehension of the text
                    (2004, p. 381). She believes that they can easily
                    get distracted and miss important plot elements.</p><br>

        <div class="research2">
            <p> 
                Although animations and such found in electronic
                books are without a doubt, appealing and
                attractive to children, De Jong says children
                understand the story more when an adult reads the
                text to them in a story time setting (p. 381). She
                completed a study in 2004 examining whether or
                not there are differences in comprehension with
                children listening to a narration of a story from an
                electronic text and children having the same text
                read to them by an adult. The researcher asked the
                children to re-tell the story that they had just heard
                (whether it was electronically, or through an adult)
                to them orally again and their results were coded.
                Her belief is that electronic books can certainly
                supplement children’s education, but is still no
                true replacement for an adult reading them a
                storybook. words after they had worked through the
                electronic book (p. 121). The best results came
                from the group who worked with the electronic
                book in the “read story with dictionary” mode, as
                they were able to have instant access to the
                definitions of words that were unfamiliar to them. </p> <br>
            <p> Higgins (1999) conducted a study to find
                out if vocabulary-building activities are effective
                when paired with animation in electronic books. In
                the control group, the children listened as the
                computer read a page of a poem to them, and then
                they watched animated definitions of specific new
                words on-screen. The researcher asked if that
                helped them understand the meaning the word. If
                they said “no”, they were permitted to access the
                animation again. In the experimental group, a
                researcher was able to speak and interact with the
                children if they viewed the animation and they still
                did not understand the meaning of the world. They
                could give a definition and also provide the
                children with a synonym (p. 427). Several days
                later, the children that participated in the study
                were tested to see if they could define certain
                words that were in the previous readings. The
                results of this study indicated that the children
                who had adult help and other instructional
                activities performed better on the test. This shows
                that vocabulary-building activities can be
                supplemented with the aid of electronic books to
                produce the best results. </p> <br>
                <p> Electronic books have also proven to be
                    able to help children with brain developmental
                    disabilities such as autism. One study learned that
                    comprehension and reading skills of autistic
                    children increased when they began to learn with
                    computers and electronic books. Their electronic
                    program consisted of flashcards with words on
                    them, letter identification and short reading
                    passages. The children showed improvement in
                    their development of vocabulary (Grant, 2004, p.
                    305). Children with other physical and learning
                    disabilities can also benefit from using electronic
                    books in the classroom. Their ability to translate
                    text-to-speech gives young readers confidence and
                    greatly boosts their self-esteem and projected self-worth (Rhodes, 2008, p. 256). Lewin (2000) also
                    conducted a study where 16 children aged 5-6
                    years old used talking electronic book software
                    daily for a month. It was found that they were
                    useful in supplementing lessons in the classroom
                    and that the children improved in their cognitive
                    skills.</p> <br> 
                <p> Hill (1996) says electronic books are more
                    appealing to children then traditional printed
                    books. They bring the story to life to children in a
                    rather lively way. It presents to them a brand new
                    perspective and makes learning a magical
                    experience. We should not worry about whether or
                    not they will replace books and think of them
                    more as another engaging way for children to
                    learn. They can just insert the CD-ROM into their
                    own computer and learn independently through
                    these images and words. Their learning is not so
                    limited anymore and their imaginations are free to
                    roam.</p> <br> 
            <h3> Conclusion: </h3>
                <p> <br> The topic of electronic texts and their advantages
                    in education is a rich and fertile ground for further
                    study and analysis. The multitude of attitudes and
                    viewpoints presented here is just a starting point.
                    Although many researchers agree that children's
                    enjoyment of electronic books might just be the
                    novelty factor, there are also documented cases
                    where electronic books can support literacy and
                    further language development. The added
                    functionality and interactivity available in
                    electronic textbooks can greatly benefit children.
                    Most children are already exposed to computers
                    and technology in our evolving fast-paced world,
                    and they generally enjoy interacting with
                    electronic books very much. They show more co-
                    operation with their peers and retain more
                    information after using an electronic book.
                    Electronic textbooks can have the ability to
                    support learning and comprehension levels seem
                    to increase when children use them in classrooms.
                    Teachers and other educators should look at
                    perhaps implementing electronic texts in their
                    teaching methods in the near future if they have
                    not done so already.</p> <br>
