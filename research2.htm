<h4> ABSTRACT </h4>
    <p><center><b><i>Along with the development of technology, the education system began to change

        function of printed books and the role of the teacher in the classroom. The focus of research 
        in this paper is how e-books can improve student skills in the 21st century. There has been a 
        number of researches related to e-books and their use in high schools. In-depth literature study 
        is needed to get a conclusion on how e-books affect students' skills, especially after studying 
        Physics. This research provides invaluable insight into how educators were maximizing the use of 
        e-books so as to improve student learning outcomes which in turn impact 21st century skills. 
        These studies describe a lot of data which enables other researchers to understand how teachers use

        e-books that have effective content and features that are relevant to e-book literacy.</p></b></i> <br> 

<div class="research2">
<h3> I. Introduction </h3>
    <p> <br>The role of technology is necessary for enabling the development of 
        innovations [1]. The latest virtual or social media will make a great breakthrough in the provision 
        of education. Innovation is recommended because it will provide changes to the conventional learning 
        process [2]. At the very least, it is expected that existing conventional learning should adopt new 
        methods [3]. In some schools, teachers have increased the use of technology-based content and resources 
        in their learning process. This evolution is often driven by a small number of teachers who are 
        diligently looking for new ways to provide content that enriches and extends learning beyond class 
        hours and the school day [4]. So teachers need to know to integrate technology into their learning activities. </p> <br> 
    <p> One of the integrations of technology into the current learning curriculum is the application of online
        learning or what we often know as electronic learning (e-learning) [5]. E-learning is essentially learning
        through the use of computer or internet technology that provides effectiveness and efficiency in learning
        [6]. The advantages of e-learning include ease of carrying out the learning process anywhere and anytime,
        improving student learning, ease of collecting information by accessing the internet, and increasing the 
        effectiveness and efficiency of learning [7].  </p> <br>
    <p> Students tend to listen to the teacher's explanation during learning activities so that learning becomes
        less interactive and collaborative [8]. This is the teacher's complaint when observing the classroom 
        management in the learning process. However, this can also be caused by teachers who are not innovative 
        in providing learning in the classroom. Teachers should know more about what students need and understand 
        better about using appropriate methods and media to attract students' interest and motivation so that they 
        are more active and learning becomes more effective.   </p> <br> 
    <p> Effectiveness in learning can be observed from the achievement of learning objectives through
        interactions that occur during the learning process [9]. It will be effective depending on the teacher's
        ability to manage the class [10]. A teacher who does not master the concepts will not be able to teach 
        well. Likewise, if a teacher does not master various ways of delivering material, it will be difficult 
        for students to understand the material. In addition, a good teacher must have the ability to apply
        psychological principles, organize the teaching and learning process, and adapt to new situations [11].  </p> <br>
    <p> The situation has changed. In the modern era, information and technology have developed rapidly.
        Nowadays, technological advances have enormous potential in developing a constructivist learning 
        environment to facilitate learning. The application of technology-based learning has many advantages, 
        especially in learning resources and activities.  </p> <br>
    <p> The use of technology in learning does not necessarily prove the advantages it promises. No matter
        how sophisticated technology is, technology is not the most powerful medicine to cure all diseases, nor
        is it a magic wand that can easily solve problems, especially problems in the learning process.
        Technology cannot provide its effectiveness in learning because it is very dependent on how the
        technology is integrated or utilized in learning activities [12].  </p> <br>
    <p> The utilization of technology in the learning process, especially the use of electronic books, certainly has 
        a major influence on the learning process. However, students are not familiar with the learning system, so the
        application of online learning is less effective. Students are still accustomed to conventional learning. Kirna 
        found that the cause of the ineffectiveness of online learning is due to the student's learning culture [13]. 
        Most students are not used to active and productive learning. Students' learning styles that have been formed 
        from traditional learning require sufficient adaptation time to shift their passive learning such as those 
        offered by online learning. That is, the integration of technology in learning should not ignore the 
        characteristics of students. Dabbagh & Ritland also stated that the success of online learning also requires
        students who are disciplined, directed, independent, and comfortable with written communication, have the 
        character of sharing information, and have technical technology skills [14]. Morin, et al. stated that 
        “Perception is an important consideration when integrating technology into learning, especially virtual learning” [15].</p> <br>
    <p> 21st century skills of students can be improved through the application of technology-based learning
        [16]. In the 21st century, every student will learn differently, so teachers are challenged to find ways to help 
        all students learn effectively. The competencies consist of : (1) Critical thinking skills and problem-
        solving, (2) Communication skills, (3) Collaboration skills, and (4) Creativity skills and innovation [17][18][19][20].
        These skills are the goals of Curriculum 2013. Of course, this is a challenge for
        teachers to be able to create the nation's next generation who can answer the challenges of the 21st century. Therefore, 
        these skills need to be developed in the learning process, as well as in solving problems related to physics subject matter. </p> <br>
    <p> Physics is part of the natural sciences. In the process of learning physics, students certainly need to
        have basic skills that must be built. The basic skills in question are generic science skills that are useful
        for students in solving problems that exist in the surrounding environment and during the learning
        process [21][22].</p> <br> 
    <p> Many students think that physics is a difficult science because there are many formulas, so it is difficult to 
        understand the concept [23]. The ability of students in solving physics problems is also still low. This is 
        because students directly use equations, memorize formulas only, and guess answers, without analyzing physics 
        problems. Therefore, students need suitable media to enhance their skill in problem solving. One of them is books. </p> <br>
    <p> Technology is used in the world of education by using electronic books. An electronic book or digital
        book is an electronic version of a book. In contrast to printed books, e-books present digital information
        in the form of text, images, animations, and videos that are more easily accessible to sources. </p> <br>
    <p> In the market, e-books have experienced significant development. E-book enthusiasts are very much
        due to their small size and affordability. Another advantage of an e-book is the e-book can display 
        animation [24]. The vision of the e-book is as an alternative format of a book/document that can be 
        downloaded. So it can be used easily anytime and anywhere. It also can save expenses for buying printed books.</p> <br> 
    <p> With the existence of e-books, it will be very helpful in the learning process especially in online learning. 
        Usually, the learning process is carried out with media sources that have been used for a long time so that 
        learning becomes less interactive. E-books provide the latest variations so that the learning
        process is not monotonous. This can trigger the curiosity of students in physics which is very closely 
        related to everyday life. The e-book presented physical phenomena that can be observed in everyday life. 
        To find out more fully and in detail the benefits of e-books in improving 21st-century skills, the author 
        conducts an in-depth literature review that will show previous research data regarding the use of
        e-books in the learning process. </p> <br>

<h3> II. Methodology </h3> <br>
       <p> This type of research is descriptive research. The research method is document study. 
        The documentary study is conducted to explore historical data through data collection from various literatures. 
        This method is more widely used in social research. Furthermore, Sugiyono explained that the document can be in the
        form of a record of an event, an image, or the monumental work of another person [25]. </p> <br> <br>

    <h3> III. Result and Discussion </h3>  <br> 
    <p> Nowadays, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, government agencies made various efforts for changes and
        adjustments, one of which was the education sector. The sector has implemented recommendations according to the policy that each 
        level of education carries out activities remotely. In line with Sa'diyah that the process is no longer carrying out conventional 
        learning but digital learning so that it requires information technology assistance to achieve the success of the teaching and learning process [26]. <br>
        The determining factors in the success of the distance education system include attention, confidence, and creativity in using assistive 
        devices so that students can easily socialize with students [27]. The teacher as a facilitator maximizes learning methods that are 
        following the characteristics of the subject matter so that students can easily receive knowledge and skills even though they 
        use the online learning system.  </p> <br>
    <p> The application of offline learning and the implementation of the Curriculum 2013 have affected the
        learning process in Indonesia. Teachers and students often experience a lack of time to get optimal
        learning outcomes. Therefore, teaching materials can support the learning process. Teaching materials 
        will make it easier for teachers to manage the learning activities [28]. Teaching materials in learning
        activities will involve teachers and students, where there are aspects to facilitate the process of providing 
        information related to the material so that the teaching materials are systematically presented. Of course, these 
        teaching materials will make it easier for students to absorb information. </p> <br> 
    <p> One of the non-printed teaching materials is an e-book. It is the same as a printed book but contains not only text or images,
        but also animation, video, or audio. It is served to be interactive and communicative. The components of an e-book are also the same as printed teaching materials.
        According to Yulaika et al., the e-book component contains competencies, indicators, learning objectives, materials, practice questions, and references [29]. 
        </p> <br> 
    <p> E-books have advantages and disadvantages. E-books have become digital teaching materials that have been widely used in recent years. 
        Its use in learning is supported by the government, especially in the context of the success of distance learning and learning in the 
        digital era. E-books play an important role in the learning process because they have advantages. The advantages of E-books can be 
        seen from the functions and benefits.</p> <br>
    <p> E-books as learning media play an important role, especially in increasing learning productivity. It is also an unlimited reference, 
        so teachers are not fixated on one learning resource. It helps teachers in managing learning time effectively. E-books are very easy 
        to carry even in large quantities, so teachers have diverse and easily accessible sources of material. </p> <br> 
    <p> The use of e-books in learning can make it easier for teachers to convey information. This happens because the information presented 
        in the e-book is more contextual so that students can learn independently and construct their own knowledge. The presentation of 
        material in the e-book can be adjusted to the interests, talents, learning styles, and abilities of students. Thus, learning can 
        be more focused and allow the provision of wider information to students. </p> <br>
    <p> E-books have had a tremendous impact on technological advancements in education. It provides a lot of convenience for teachers in 
        finding and adding references to learning resources. The use of e-books can improve learning efficiency because of 
        its very easy access. 
     <br>
        In addition to having several advantages, e-books also have disadvantages. Copyright issues are the main point of this weakness. 
        It is very easy to copy, it is certainly a problem in itself. It is very susceptible to damage, such as being exposed to viruses 
        or damage to files due to misuse. The marketing side can also be a weakness of e-books. In this era, there are still many people 
        who do not have devices to access them. Most people are also more comfortable using printed books.</p> <br> 
    <p> Education today requires learning resources that can improve 21st-century skills. By developing 21st-century skills in learning, 
        every individual has the skills to live in the 21st century with various opportunities and challenges in the era of technological
        progress and information. Several experts explain the importance of mastering various 21st-century skills as a means of success in 
        a century where the world is developing rapidly and dynamically.
    <br>
        The success indicator is based on the ability to communicate, share information and use it to solve complex problems, be able to 
        innovate in the face of rapidly changing conditions, and use technology to create new knowledge. The inability of children to express
        their desires, feelings and actualize what is within them makes the problems faced by children even bigger. So that children need the 
        ability and skill to express the problems they face to others. The achievement of these skills can be supported through the teacher's 
        efforts in designing learning activities that direct students to think critically in solving the problems given. Learning activities 
        must also support the creation of good collaboration and communication during the learning process.</p> <br> 
    <p> Communication is a process of language exchange that takes place in the human world. Therefore, It always involves humans both in 
        intrapersonal, group, and mass contexts. Researchers prove that until now language is recognized as the most effective medium in 
        communicating in an interaction between individuals as well as in the teaching and learning process. Communicating means speech 
        and social development, namely how communication can take place in two directions. Communication is said to
        be acceptable if the message can be received well.
    <br>
        Along with the times, effective communication is very much needed. Effective communication can produce changes in attitudes in 
        others that can be seen in the communication process. Effective communication is so that the delivery of information and feedback 
        can be balanced so that it is not monotonous. To achieve this, the e-book used should also be communicative.</p> <br> 
    <p> Some researchers have proven that students will study harder if they are actively involved in the
        learning process in groups. Students with groups will more easily remember the concept compared to conventional ways [30]. 
        Collaborative forms of social interaction as a means to build knowledge [31]. Learning includes collaborative learning if the group 
        members are not certain or predetermined, can consist of two people, several people, or even more than seven people. 
        Furthermore, Wasono argue that collaborative learning can occur at any time, not necessarily at school, for example, a group of students
        helping each other in doing homework, even it can take place between students from different classes or different schools. 
        So, it can be informal, that is, it does not have to be carried out in the classroom and learning does not need to be structured strictly [30].</p> <br>
    <p> E-books not only help students in developing communication and collaboration but also develop critical problem-solving skills. 
        Critical thinking is a systematic skill used in problem solving, decision making, analyzing a case, and conducting scientific 
        research steps. Critical thinking shows a person's way of thinking in an organized manner. Critical thinking is the ability to 
        systematically weigh personal ideas and the assumptions of others [32].
    <br> 
        Thinking is essentially an active process in which critical thinking about things in-depth, asking questions for yourself, finding 
        relevant information for yourself rather than accepting things from others [33]. Elaine B. Johnson states that critical thinking 
        aims to produce a deep understanding [32]. Critical thinking is to guarantee, as far as possible, that our thinking is valid and correct. 
        With the ability to think critically students will be able to solve the problems they face. </p> <br> 
    <p> The next 21st-century skill is creativity and innovation. Creativity is an idea of a human being. It is
        innovative, efficient, and understandable. It is the ability to produce new methods in problem-solving. It is an imaginative activity that manifests (embodiment) the ingenuity of a mind which is capable of
        producing a product or solving a problem in its way.
   <br> The creative process will only occur if it is generated through problems that show five kinds of
        creative behavior as follows: 
        1) fluency - the ability to express similar ideas to solve a problem, 
        2) flexibility - the ability to generate various kinds of ideas to solve a problem, 
        3) originality - the ability to provide a unique or extraordinary response, 
        4) elaboration - the ability to state the direction of ideas in detail to make ideas into reality, 
        and 5) sensitivity - to catch and produce problems in response to a situation. Children's creativity 
        can develop well if it is supported by several factors such as 1) providing good mental stimulation, 
        2) creating a conducive environment, 3) teacher participation in developing creativity, and 
        4) parental participation. Innovation is a new method or idea that a person has to achieve
        certain goals or to solve problems.  </p> <br> 
    <p> In previous studies, it was explained that e-books are very important to improve 21st-century skills.
        Research conducted by Heni Pujiastuti showed that there were significant changes in student learning 
        outcomes in urban areas after using e-books. The developed e-book is said to be feasible to use with 
        achievement scores obtained from content experts 87.50%, media experts 90%, student responses 88.57%,
        and student learning outcomes 84.33% [34].
   <br> Another study conducted by López-Escribano showed that e-books were very helpful in increasing children's 
        reading literacy [35]. The availability and use of digital devices in the 21st century is increasing. 
        Significant advantages of the e-book intervention were found for phonological awareness and vocabulary 
        learning in 14 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) based on data from 1,138 children. The proper selection 
        and use of e-books can develop students' literacy skills better than the use of printed books. 
        In addition, the e-book intervention outperformed regular school programs in literacy skills development. 
        Similarly, the enhanced state of the e-book revealed the benefits of the non-enhanced e- book intervention 
        in the acquisition of literacy skills. The effect of these findings related to health issues, e-book design, 
        and disadvantaged populations. </p> <br>
    <p> Research by Huang shows e-books encourage better reading practices and increase student motivation [36]. 
        Moreover, They consider e-books to be more available, portable, and eco-friendly than print-based texts.
        However, students also noted difficulties with reading e-books in terms of eye fatigue and dealing with 
        long texts. Suggestions for improving future e-book reading programs can serve as a model for integrating 
        new literacy formats such as the iPad, Amazon Kindle, or other mobile device into the L2 reading curriculum.
   <br> Yager notes that e-book users benefit from the rich features in it [37]. The features in the e-book provide students 
        with opportunities to develop better study skills as technology skills improve. It is hoped that by 
        combining technology and good pedagogical methods, students will more effectively learn content and develop 
        better knowledge and technology skills. </p> <br> 
    <p> Previous research has proven that interactive e-books can build students' knowledge and metacognitive through a 
        series of comprehensive e-book reading activities [38]. In a study in Taiwan, it was found that the use of 
        interactive e-books was very effective in increasing students' visual attention in learning vocabulary. 
        Students spend quite a lot of time reading text but not with text accompanied by animation or graphic data [39]. 
        Many students rarely read and are less motivated to read. If teachers fail to provide support for students who 
        have difficulty getting used to reading, these students will experience academic problems for years [40]. 
        Therefore, interactive e-books are very necessary for fostering students' interest in reading which can 
        then be continued to improve HOTS and 4C abilities. </p> <br> 
    <p> HOTS is an abstract ability that includes the ability to analyze, evaluate, and be creative. HOTS
        contains 4 indicators, namely problem solving, decision-making skills, critical thinking skills, and 
        creative thinking skills [41]. In learning Physics, high-level thinking skills are needed because it 
        require students to reason, analyze, solve problems, and critically and creatively apply the theories 
        obtained to solve Physics problems [42]. Not only the ability to think (ways of thinking), the skills 
        and attitudes that are expected to develop in the 21st century (industrial revolution 4.0) also include 
        literacy and soft skills (ways to learning), and personal, social, and civic responsibility 
        (ways to learning with other people) which is hereinafter referred to as 4C [43].</p> <br> 

    <p>  Based on the literature review, it was concluded that e-books have more advantages than disadvantages. The advantages of e-books are summarized in Table 1.</p> <br> 
         <p> <center> <b>Table 1. </b> Advantages of using e-book in learning </p>
