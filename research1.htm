        <h4> ABSTRACT </h4>
            <p><center><b><i>In this study, e-book research articles were reviewed which are published in various library science and non-library 
                science journals. Identifies facets and significant results of e-book research. For this review, literature on e-books 
                published in English language, in 2016 was searched from various databases. The review finds that the focus of current research 
                on e-books is on use. Themes such as e-book collection development and management; search and discovery are also paid more 
                attention to. Use of e-books by children is emerging as a prominent area of e-book research. Results of most of the research 
                on e-books are supportive to each other.</p> <br>

        <h3> I. Introduction </h3>
            <p><br>E-books have now become an integral part of library collections. E-books emerged little 
                later than e-journals, but they have soon become important with reference to library budgets, acquisition, cataloguing, 
                services and usage. Users too are attracted to this format of reading material. Many stakeholders have interest in e-books 
                from different points of view. For example, the publishers and aggregators are interested in e-books as a market commodity. 
                The library professionals are keenly interested in e-books as a new format to serve users and an another opportunity to 
                extend their services. Researchers from many other subject areas too are interested in this new communication format. 
                At this background the author is interested in knowing the current trends in e-book research with reference to topics 
                covered and major findings. Earlier author did review the research on e-book published during 2010.</p><br><br>
 
        <h3> II. Objectives, scope and method</h3>
            <p><br>This research intends to identify the facets of e-books attended to by the research 
                published during 2016. It also intends to review significant results and their supportive or contradictory nature. 
                To fulfill these aims the researcher searched articles on e-books from LISA, Emerald Insight, Ebsco and Google Scholar databases. 
                ‘E-books OR ebooks’ statement was used for searching literature. The query was restricted to journal articles published in 
                English language without any geographical limitation. The scope was delimited to January to December 2016. All the above databases 
                together retrieved about 200 article. The retrieved items were deduplicated. In the final reading few articles were sorted out 
                as irrelevant and finally 78 article were identified as relevant and are reviewed here.</p><br><br> 

        <h3> III. Purpose of using e-books </h3>
            <p><br> Different users use e-books for different purposes. 
                For example, Wang and Bai found that undergraduate students mainly used e-books for 
                leisure purpose. Contrary to this the postgraduate students used e-books more for 
                academic purposes. Similarly, Carroll, et al. observed that overall the use of e-books 
                for academic purpose has increased considerably. Koçak, et al. also noticed that students 
                preferred e-books while studying. Khan, et al. and Lewellen , et al.found that postgraduate 
                students used e-books more than the undergraduates. Carroll, et al. has observed that 
                general reference books were favoured in e-book format than in print. However, a study of 
                the e-book usage by the academia in an Indian university library found that reference e-books 
                were used very frequently (Nikam & Shivraj). The different national background must be responsible 
                for these variations in results. Inquiring about gender-wise differences in e-book usage Khan, et al. 
                found that compared with female students, male students (in Pakistan) universities used e-books more frequently. 
                However, Lewellen, et al. noticed that there is little difference by gender in use of e-books and printed books. 
                Investigating about the correlation, if any, between length of reading and type of book formats preferred, 
                Goertzen and Bakkalbasi noticed that students preferred e-books for discontinuous reading; quick reference, 
                whereas printed books were preferred for continuous or prolonged reading.<br><br>
                Rafiq and Warraich studying e-book usage pattern of undergraduate medical students in Pakistan noticed that 
                most students read e-books for academic purpose but still preferred to read textbooks in print format. 
                Carroll, et al. found that more students favoured literary works in printed format than in e-book format. 
                Contrary to this the general public favoured fictions in e-book format especially for holidays and did not favour 
                nonfictions in e-book format10. It must be specially noted that these are non-academic users whereas 
                Carroll’s respondents were academic users. Asai studied format choice for popular fiction in Japan and found that 
                compared with e-novels, e-comics are popular format. <br><br>
                As far as use of e-books by students of specific subject is concerned Letchumanan and Muniandy12 found that 
                the mathematics postgraduate students mostly used mobile e-books for study and to find information for their research 
                activities. Jou, et al. studied use of e-books and APP and found that e-books were used by engineering students in 
                classroom setting to study the principles of mechanical drawing and APP was used for creating mechanical drawings. 
                Librarians often wish to know whether readers in a particular discipline favour e-books or printed books. 
                Knowlton developed a two-step model useful for this purpose. It could be noticed from the above discussions that 
                there is a fair amount of research investigating purposes of using e-books. However, e-books are not used to the 
                desired magnitude in an Indian horticulture and forestry university (Bhat and Ganaie). When enquired whether students 
                like e-books or not the survey of Estelle found mixed reactions.</p><br><br>    

                <h3>IV. Reasons for using e-books </h3> 
            <p><br> Quick to read and easy to manage formats, aesthetics, ‘task-technology fit’, anywhere anytime 
            availability, user friendliness, etc. are some of the common reasons for using e-books. According to Dean, e-textbooks are used 
            because they can engage students and help them succeed in their studies. Ahmad and Brogan observed that academic library users 
            favoured e-books because of familiarity, usability, utility and hedonic attributes. Being able to use even when the library is 
            closed and could be used simultaneously by many users are the other reasons why users preferred e-books (Oliva). E-books are 
            technological products. Okocha applied the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) model to test the reasons 
            for acceptance of e-books by university students. The author found that performance expectancy, effort expectancy and facilitating 
            conditions influenced student’s decision to use e-books. <br><br>
            Liaw and Huang’s investigation revealed that interactive learning environments, acceptable screen size, perceived self-regulation, 
            and self-efficacy could positively influence usefulness of e-books as learning tools. Johnson found a correlation between use of 
            e-books and ability to learn. He observed that education students who embrace e-books perceive themselves as abler learners than 
            students who do not. E-books enable to find micro contents from the text. This feature works as a better substitute to index in a 
            printed reference books. Ogden has explained this with the help of electronic version of an 80-year-old Hamilton and Hardy’s book 
            entitled Industrial Toxicology. </p><br><br> 

            <h3>V. Awareness and use of e-books </h3>
            <p><br> For increasing use it is important that users are aware
            about the e-book titles available, various formats of e-books,
            different e-book platforms, their scope, search features, etc.
            Sarjoon and Kabir studied the awareness and use of e-books
            by the doctoral researchers at the Indian Institute of Science
            Education and Research and found that almost all the users are aware of e-books and 
            related technologies. However, Wendo and Mwanzu noticed that there is insufficient 
            awareness amongst the university students in Kenya about e-books. 
            These differences about awareness are from two different countries.
            Awareness and use of e-books should ideally be positively correlated. 
            However, Okocha in case study of a university library found that majority of the 
            students were aware of e-books, but many had used e-books only once. Wang and Bai
            too found that there was higher awareness but lower adoption
            of general e-books by the university students in China.</p><br><br>

        <h3> VI. Reasons Not for using e-books </h3>
            <p><br>Findability and accessibility of e-books through library
            website is the most consistent concerns and barriers to use
            e-books. Goertzen and Bakkalbasi also observed that
            availability and accessibility limited by platforms and licenses
            cause frustrations in the use of e-books. Koçak as well as Rafiq
            and Warraich recognised that eye fatigue is a reason for not preferring e-books. Nikam and Shivraj recognised that lack of
            awareness amongst the users is the main hindrance in the usage
            of e-books. Hobbs and Klare observed that the features in
            e-books have not enhanced with the expected speed and due to
            this student continue to encounter issues with interface designs
            as well as the ability to easily control and manipulate their own copies. Whatever may be the reasons for non-use or less use
            of e-books, Rafiq and Warraich believed that librarians can
            play a vital role in minimising the barriers. Seth and Kelly
            observed that readers feel less connected to book when reading
            e-books and therefore prefer printed books. They further stated
            that these findings with align ‘self-concept theory’ and indicate that printed books are an extension of the self. </p> <br><br> 

            VII. E-books collection development </h3> 
            <p><br> A good e-book collection development policy helps ‘to
            acquire quality e-books at least cost with most suitable terms and
            conditions and having effective access mechanism’. However,
            to be effective, an e-book collection development policy
            needs to be revised regularly. Type and size of library need to
            be considered while revising e-book collection development
            policy. Lukes, et al. describe how two different approaches
            were adopted for revising e-book collection development policy
            by small college libraries. In addition to policies, quantitative   
            and qualitative longitudinal studies of students’ perceptions
            help in collection development of e-books. Similarly, Bozarth
            and Zhong29 suggested that understanding of users’ preferences
            about e-books does help in collection development. Tri-Agif30,
            et al. recognised that satisfaction and perceived ease of use
            are the determinants of continuance intention of using e-books.
            The authors suggest that these determinants could be used in
            evaluating and selecting e-books before purchasing. <br><br>
