        <h1>Fundamentals Of Information Technology</h1>
        <h2>By: Shambhavi Roy, Clinton Daniel, and Manish Agrawal</h2> <br> <br>
        <p> How do you spend your free time? How do you communicate with friends? How do you complete schoolwork? How do you find the information you need? How do you buy things you like? What are some of your most prized possessions? What do some of the business celebrities you admire do? On completing school, what are some of the popular high-paying jobs in your town that you might be interested in doing? In the first half of the 21st century, Digital Information Technologies (DIT), or Information Technologies (IT) for short, are likely to be part of the answer to all these questions. Slowly but steadily, DIT has dramatically influenced our lives to the point where it is now necessary for all students to know the essentials of using DIT to improve their lives. This book, the accompanying materials, and the DIT course aim to do just that. At the end of this class, you should be able to explain to friends and family how computers work. You should also feel comfortable using computers to improve your own effectiveness. 
           </p><br>
        
        <p>Information technologies are powerful because people crave information, and IT makes it easy for people to get this information. 
          The world is teeming with information about who we are, where we live, and what we do to sustain ourselves. 
          Until very recently, before the advent of computers in approximately 1990, this information was written on paper, published in newspapers or magazines, and stored in libraries and stacks of files in offices. 
          In your own personal lives, you and your parents probably cherish family photo albums with printed photographs. Before computers, there was no easy way for people to share information with each other.
          Businesses did not have easy access to data about their own customers to understand larger patterns and take corrective actions.</p><br>
        
        <p>Beginning in the 1990s, computers became popular, and starting in the 21st century, computers got connected to each other through the Internet, and the field of Information Technology (IT) was born. 
          IT is the use of computers and networking technologies to store, process, and retrieve information. 
          IT is now so important to organizations that IT investments, which include computers, networks, software, and employees are now one of the largest expenses for most organizations.</p><br>

        <p>In today’s digital age, technology permeates every aspect of our lives. 
          Understanding the fundamentals of information technology is increasingly critical for personal satisfaction and professional success. 
          Whether you are a curious novice or an aspiring technology professional, this book is your gateway to unlocking the mysteries and endless possibilities of the world of computing.</p><br>
 
        <p>This book aims to give someone with no background in information technology the essential working knowledge of computers while also offering a sweeping view of the more complex topics. 
          Whether you aspire to build cutting-edge applications, do groundbreaking research, or simply want to gain a deeper understanding of technology to be proficient at your job, this book will equip you with the essential knowledge and tools to thrive.</p><br> 

        <p>By the end of this book, you will know the history of computers; be comfortable using the common productivity tools to write a document, create a spreadsheet, make a presentation, send an email; organize your files; use the web for research; understand the ethical issues associated with information technology; and know the pitfalls of social media. 
          This will help you participate in intelligent conversations about current and upcoming technologies with professionals in the field. </p><br>

        <p>Through clear explanations, practical examples, and hands-on exercises, we aim to demystify complex concepts like cybersecurity and computer networks, empower you to think critically, and encourage you to embrace a creative and problem-solving mindset that lies at the heart of information technology. 
          We also hope that this information will encourage you to consider college and career options in the dynamic world of digital information technologies. 
           </p><br>

        <p>Are you ready to embark on this adventure? Let’s dive into the captivating realm of digital information technologies and unlock the boundless opportunities therein. </p><br>
